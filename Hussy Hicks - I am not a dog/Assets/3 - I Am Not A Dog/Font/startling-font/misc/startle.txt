Thanks for downloading STARTLING

DESCRIPTION:

Take me to your leader! The genesis of STARTLING was a reproduction in miniature of a cover from that old pulp Science Fiction magazine, "Startling Stories." I thought the masthead appealing, so I ventured to extrapolate an entire alphabet with only the characters A,E,G,I,O,L,N,R,S, and T as my guide. The result is a mixed bag that seems a heckuva lot more wacky than the venerable nameplate that sired this misbegotten font. Sets well at point sizes 18 and above.

Incidentally, I recently noticed that a very similar font, one also obviously modeled on the "Startling Stories" masthead, was used for the opening titles of that infectious, goofy 1989 film "Earth Girls Are Easy."

Note: This font has no punctuation whatsoever. Have fun with it anyway.

This font is free to use in all your designs and layouts. STARTLING may be duplicated and given away as often as you see fit, as long as you INCLUDE THIS README FILE. Please don't rename it, and/or tell people you made it, because then really bad things could happen to you--possibly a harrowing alien abduction involving very painful rectal probes and a really obnoxious redneck roommate from a trailer park somewhere in Arkansas. By the way, if you use this in a commercial layout, please drop by my website and drop me a line. I'm always curious about how these things get used.
